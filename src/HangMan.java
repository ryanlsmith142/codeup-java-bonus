        STRING BONUS CHALLENGE
        Create a command line Hangman game!
        Create a Java class called Hangman. In the main method, you may find defining the following variables helpful (you decide which variables need an initialized starting value):
        Scanner sc;
        String wordSoFar;
        String wordGuess;
        String wordCopy = "";
        String chooseGuessLetterOrWord;
        String letterGuess;
        int noOfRounds;
        You decide how many guesses the user has before the game is over. You should start trying to make the game work with only three letter words.
        Can you prevent the user from entering an invalid choice when asked to guess a letter or a word?
        Can you make the console output look fancy?
         */
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        String wordSoFar;

        String wordGuess;

        String wordCopy = "";

        String chooseGuessLetterOrWord;

        String letterGuess;

        int noOfRounds;







    }
